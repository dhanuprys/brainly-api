## Troubleshooting 😠
### Deploy to the server
Many people say that brainly-api has problems when deploying to Heroku. This was not caused by a flaw in the program, but from the security of the Brainly itself. They use Cloudflare for security.
As another experiment, brainly-api works well with Microsoft Azure.
If you have any suggestions for deploying brainly-api for free, you can do a pull request.
### US Server restricted anywhere
Usually, many people ask why when the test on localhost is running well while on hosting it gives a 403 error. However, in this case, if you use US as the server then it will not work well on local and hosting. This is due to the security of Cloudflare.
